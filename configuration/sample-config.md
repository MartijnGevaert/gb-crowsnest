# Sample config

During the installation of Crowsnest a sample configuration named `crowsnest.conf` was already placed in `printer_data/config` folder. In Mainsail you can edit the file in the config section.

A basic template will be created during the installation.

This will start crowsnest, if a camera is attached, with plain defaults.

The template can be viewed [here](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/crowsnest/blob/master/resources/crowsnest.conf).
