# Help!

## I need help! Something is not working as expected...

Well, please join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mainsail) and open a Post in our support-forum.

{% hint style="info" %}
It might take a while to get an response, so please be patient.

Keep calm and be kindly :wink:
{% endhint %}

When opening a new Post, please be descriptive as possible. That makes it easier for our helpers or the team members itself, to help you!

* Use a short and descriptive title
* Provide a screenshot in title, if possible
* Be prepared to upload a Log in the following setup:

```
log_level: debug
delete_log: true
```

* If possible use `make report` and provide the file `report.txt`, located in your `home` directory

{% hint style="info" %}
**General advice**: Crowsnest's log file is really descriptive and should already point you in the right direction. _Read it!_
